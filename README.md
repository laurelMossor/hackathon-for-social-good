# You're Not Alone: Mental Health Data in the U.S.
Youâ€™re Note Alone: Health Data in the US is a single page web app focused on bringing education and resources around mental health to the public. We strived to build a colorful, intuitive and interactive web application showcasing data visualizations aimed at creating visibility and reducing the stigma around mental health and mental illness. The application displays multiple visualizations accompanied by educational captions and resources aimed to encourage people to seek help, facilitate coalition building, and influence policy change.
