# You're Not Alone: Mental Health Data in the U.S.
### The Project:
Youâ€™re Note Alone: Health Data in the US is a single page web app focused on bringing education and resources around mental health to the public. 

### What we did:
We strived to build a colorful, intuitive and interactive web application showcasing data visualizations aimed at creating visibility and reducing the stigma around mental health and mental illness. 

### Why this matters:
The application combines information from several sources, some of which can be lengthy reports, to displays multiple visualizations accompanied by educational captions and resources aimed to show that there are others experiencing, treating, and caring for their mental health, and they are not just a statistic. It also encourages people to seek help, facilitate coalition building, and influence policy change.
